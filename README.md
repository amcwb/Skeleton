# Colour detection

This is a small project that uses `opencv` to detect regions of certain colours from webcams. The original goal was to set up tracking to enable the virtualisation of certain controls.

## Running
To run, firstly install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the main code:
```
py main.py
```

## Extension
All logic takes place in `skeleton.py`, and the logic of the image collection occurs there.
